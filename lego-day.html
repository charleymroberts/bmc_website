                    <p>On November 25th a group of Bamford villagers organised a Christmas Market
                        to provide funds for new equipment for the Recreation Ground play area.
                    Stalls were set up in the car parks of the ‘Anglers Rest’ which is celebrating
                        ten years of community ownership this year.</p>

                    <p>As the ‘Anglers’ is directly opposite the Methodist Church in Bamford,
                        we decided to help out by providing facilities, staffing and equipment
                        for a LEGO DAY.</p>

                    <p>Tall, wide, fragile, intricate and interesting models were made and a
                        good time was had by all - including some adults who were deep in
                        concentration ‘helping’ their offspring and enjoying every minute of
                        their excuse to play Lego! Even two well-behaved dogs came along —
                        but purely to watch, you understand!</p>

                    <p>With a congregation mainly of folks of advancing years it becomes
                        increasingly important to build up links with young families in the
                        community and this event gave us an excellent opportunity to do just that.</p>

                    <p>The switching on of the village Christmas lights followed, mulled wine
                        was served , the Chapel cross shone out brightly, and Father Christmas
                        came along to join in the fun.</p>

                    <p>New friends were made and a happy (if tiring day for some!) time was
                        enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>
